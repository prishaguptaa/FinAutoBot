## Overview
This system provides financial analysis of customer bank transactions with life event detection capabilities. It uses transaction pattern analysis and AI-based detection to identify significant life events such as:
- New Baby
- Job Change
- Wedding
- Home Purchase

## Technical Components

### Server-side (Python)
1. **Transaction Analysis (event_detection.py)**
   - Parses CSV bank statement data
   - Analyzes monthly aggregates and categorizes transactions
   - Identifies recurring transactions and their changes over time
   - Detects large single transactions (≥50% of category total)
   - Generates comprehensive analysis summaries

2. **Life Event Detection**
   - Uses Google's Generative AI (Gemini) to detect life events
   - Analyzes transaction patterns to identify significant life changes
   - Returns structured responses with event type and reasoning

3. **API Endpoints**
   - `/hello` - Accepts bank statement file uploads and returns analysis with event detection
   - `/recommendation` - Provides portfolio recommendations based on detected events and goals

### Client-side (Next.js)
1. **File Upload System**
   - BankStatementUpload component handles file selection and upload
   - Displays progress indicators during upload and processing
   - Passes detected event information back to the main application

2. **Event Display Components**
   - UserOverview displays user badges based on detected events
   - LifeEventAlerts shows filtered events relevant to current detection
   - GoalSelectionForm displays event details and reasoning

3. **Modal System**
   - Prevents background scrolling when modals are open
   - Ensures modals have appropriate sizing and scrolling capabilities
   - Maintains responsive design across different screen sizes

## Integration Flow
1. User uploads bank statement through the interface
2. File is sent to server for processing
3. Server analyzes transaction data and detects life events
4. Results are returned to client application
5. UI updates to display detected event and relevant financial recommendations
6. User can confirm events and select financial goals
7. System provides personalized portfolio recommendations
